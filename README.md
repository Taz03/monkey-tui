# MonkeyType TUI

### Installation
#### Clone the project using
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Taz03/monkeytype-tui
```

#### Enter the project directory with
```bash
$ cd monkeytype-tui
```

#### Go to the <a href="https://monkeytype.com/settings">MonkeyType</a> settings tab
#### Click the `Go to the danger zone` button under the `More Account Settings` header.
#### Click the `export` button to copy your MonkeyType settings to the system clipboard.
#### While in the project root directory, create a json file `config.json` and paste the exported json inside

#### You can now run the app with
```bash
$ go run .
``` 

### Usage
#### After setup, there is no way to tweak settings through the program. However, you can go back to monkeytype and change settings on the website. You can then repeat steps 4-6 in order to apply the changes to the app. <br>

### Bugs!
#### If you encounter any bugs, please open a github issue. Describe clearly the issue you're experiencing and the circumstances that may have caused it if applicable. <br>

### We are in an early stage of development so there is a lot of room for improvement. 
### Any gophers willing to contribute to the project are highly appreciated <3
